1. a. The Bresenham line algorithms here are hardcoded for lines that are not
      vertical. This is an acceptable starting point because most lines are
      going to have a slope of some kind.
      
   b. The algorithms need to handle when dx === 0 (that is, they need not to
      return instantly because x starts out as equal to x2). When this is the
      case, they should just iterate through every pixel on X = x from y to y2.

2. [To which implementation does the question refer?]

3. Much like filling in the polygon with a solid color, the fillPolygon
   function should start at the top left corner of the rectangle bounding the
   polygon and move right across the row. The pixel drawer should start in the
   off-position and toggle every time an edge is crossed. In the implementation
   of fillPolygon which blends colors, when an edge is met the color should be
   set to the "blend progress" from the first vertex to the second vertex
   forming the edge; this blend progress color is found by taking the change
   in each of rgb per unit distance from the first vertex to the second and
   multiplying each by the distance from the first vertex to the current point.
   The pixel drawer should find the next edge in the row and find the blend
   progress at that point. For each pixel between edges in this row, the blend
   progress should be found from the left edge point to the right edge point,
   and the pixel drawer should use that color, blending from edge to edge.
